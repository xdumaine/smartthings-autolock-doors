# Autolock Doors

![icon](app-icon.png)

This SmartThings SmartApp enables you to set up your doors to automatically lock
after a period of being unlocked. It has an optional setting to disable locking
in a specific mode.

For example, create a "Party" mode for your "Home" Location, and select this mode
in the app. Now, when your "Home" Location is in "Party" mode, doors will not
automatically lock.

Inspired by my own desire to have locking doors but not all the time.
